        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A family-loved meal that is quick and easy to make with just a few ingredients. A hotdog can also be made into a chilicheese hotdog if desired.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>hotdog buns</li>
            <li>your choice or sausage</li>
            <li>ketchup</li>
            <li>mustard</li>
            <li>mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.</li>
            <li>Place tray on hot side of grill and cook until simmering, about 7 minutes. Slide to cooler side of grill. Cover grill with vents over the hot dogs. Cook with all vents open until hot dogs are heated through, about 10 minutes, turning once halfway through cooking.</li>
            <li>Remove lid. Using tongs, remove hot dogs and place directly on cooking grates over hot side of grill. Cook, turning occasionally, until well browned and crisp, about 3 minutes total. Toast buns over hot side of grill if desired. Serve hot dogs with buns, mustard, mayonnaise, and ketchup.</li>
        </ol>
